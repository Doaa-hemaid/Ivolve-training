# SSH Configuration Setup

# 1. Install OpenSSH Server
# This command installs the OpenSSH server package, enabling SSH access to the machine.
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
----------------
# 2. Enable and Start the SSH Service
# Ensure the SSH service is enabled to start on boot and is currently running.
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh  # Verify that the SSH service is active and running
-------------------
# 3. Generate SSH Keys
# Generate a new RSA key pair (private and public) for secure authentication.
# The key will be stored in the specified file (ivolve_key).
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ivolve_key

# 4. Copy Public SSH Key to Remote Machine
# Use ssh-copy-id to copy the public key to the remote server's authorized_keys file.
# This allows passwordless login for the user 'doaa' on the remote machine (IP: 192.168.225.129).
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ivolve_key.pub doaa@192.168.225.129 

# 5. Establish SSH Connection
# Connect to the remote server using the private key for authentication.
# This will prompt for the passphrase if one was set during key generation.
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ivolve_key doaa@192.168.225.129
------------------------------------
# 6. Configure SSH to Use an Alias
# Edit the SSH configuration file to create an alias for the remote connection.
# This allows you to connect to the remote server using the simple command 'ssh ivolve'.
vim ~/.ssh/config

# Add a new host configuration for 'ivolve' with the following settings:
Host ivolve
    HostName 192.168.225.129  # Remote server's IP address
    User doaa                 # Username for login
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ivolve_key  # Path to the private key for authentication

-------------------
# 7. Test Connection with Alias
# Now, you can simply use the alias 'ivolve' to establish an SSH connection to the remote server.
# The SSH client will automatically use the settings defined in ~/.ssh/config.
ssh ivolve
